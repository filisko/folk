In addition to basic needs, beverages form part of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture\">culture</a> of human society. Although all beverages, including juice, soft drinks, and carbonated drinks, have some form of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water\">water</a> in them, water itself is often not classified as a beverage, and the word <em><a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/beverage\">beverage</a></em> has been recurrently defined as not referring to water.</p>\r\n"
